# Support for legacy versions of QIF

Here you will find sample instance files and source code bindings for past versions of QIF. 

_Note_: These are **legacy** versions of QIF and should be supported only for legacy purposes. To support interoperability with QIF, you should use the latest version of QIF. You can find the supporting files for the latest version of QIF [at the root of this repository](https://github.com/QualityInformationFramework/qif-community).
