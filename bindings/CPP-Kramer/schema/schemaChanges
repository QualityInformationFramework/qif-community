have been made in the schema files in this directory.

In all of the schema files that xs:include other schema files, the
schemaLocation has been changed by removing the directory path. In some
files, white space has been changed. Other changes follow.

Moved ArithmeticParameterValueType and VariableValueType to Expressions.xsd.

Moved ArithmeticParameterValue and VariableValue from the extensions
of the ArithmeticExpression substitution group into the extensions of
the ArithmeticExpression substitution group in Expressions.xsd.

Moved TokenParameterValueType to GenericExpressions.xsd.

Moved TokenParameterValue from the extensions of the TokenExpression
substitution group into the TokenExpression substitution group in
GenericExpressions.xsd.

QIFProduct.xsd
--------------

non-optional, and an sequence wrapping a choice has been removed.

Expressions.xsd
---------------
Moved in ArithmeticParameterValueType and VariableValueType from QIFPlan.xsd.

Moved ArithmeticParameterValue and VariableValue from the extensions
of the ArithmeticExpression substitution group in QIFPlan.xsd into the
extensions of the ArithmeticExpression substitution group.

Features.xsd
------------
Two optional elements inside xs:choice have been made non-optional.

GenericExpressions.xsd
----------------------
Moved in TokenParameterValueType from QIFPlan.xsd.

Moved TokenParameterValue from the extensions of the TokenExpression
substitution group in QIFPlan.xsd into the TokenExpression
substitution group.

Note that in the generated C++, GenericExpressionsClasses.cc must
#include ExpressionsClasses.hh

Geometry.xsd
--------------
In the Polyline13CoreType a sequence surrounding a choice was removed.
In the Polyline12CoreType a sequence surrounding a choice was removed.
In the PathTriangulationCoreType a sequence surrounding a choice was removed.

IntermediatesPMI.xsd
--------------------
xs:complexContent is changed to xs:simpleContent in the following types
(all of which are near the end of the file). Using xs:complexContent is
not incorrect, but it is pointless and makes parsing harder.
  PointSetReferenceBaseType
  PointSetReferenceWholeType
  PointSetReferenceRangeType
  PointSetReferenceSingleType

Primitives.xsd
--------------
xs:complexContent is changed to xs:simpleContent in the following types.
Using xs:complexContent is not incorrect, but it is pointless and makes
parsing harder.
  PolyLineType
  QIFReferenceFullType
UserDataXML is commented out in the AttributeUserType.

PrimitivesPD.xsd
-----------------
No other change.

PrimitivesPMI.xsd
-----------------
No other change.

Statistics.xsd
--------------
In 12 places the structure of a complexType has been changed from

Choice
    Sequence
         optional value
         optional maxValue
         optional minValue
    Sequence
         optional deviation
         optional maxDeviation
         optional minDeviation

to

Choice
     Sequence
          value
          optional maxValue
          optional minValue
     Sequence
          maxValue
          optional minValue
     minValue
     Sequence
          deviation
          optional maxDeviation
          optional minDeviation
    Sequence
          maxDeviation
          optional minDeviation
    minDeviation

This both makes the structure easier to parse and disallows a completely
empty instance, which is possible with the original structure and was
not the intent of the original structure.

Topology.xsd
------------
No other change.

Traceability.xsd
-----------------
No other change.

Units.xsd
---------
No other change.

Visualization.xsd
-----------------
In Area2dType made elements in choice be non-optional.
