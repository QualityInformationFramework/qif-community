# COMPILING...  COMPLETE

Source code bindings for QIF3 are now ready: 

* C++
* C#
* Python

## Update - Mar 9, 2020

The second C++ binding has been updated (QIF3.0DocumentBundle2020Mar9.zip).

In addition to two versions of an open source app that creates the same QIF instance file as the other three apps, the Mar 9 zip file contains free open source C++ classes for all of QIF 3.0 and a QIF 3.0 file parser.
