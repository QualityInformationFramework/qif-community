# COMPILING...  COMPLETE

Source code bindings for QIF3 are now ready: 

* C++
* C#
* Python

## Update - Feb 14, 2020

A second C++ binding has been added (QIF3.0DocumentBundle2020Feb14.zip).

In addition to two versions of an open source app that creates the same QIF instance file as the other three apps, the Feb 14 zip file contains free open source C++ classes for all of QIF 3.0 and a QIF 3.0 file parser.
