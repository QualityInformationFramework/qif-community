# QIF 3.0 Sample Instance Files

In this directory you will find sample instance files for QIF 3.0. (For samples of previous versions of QIF, see the `_legacy` folder.) 

All the files are valid to the QIF 3.0 schemas, and have no errors when checked with the XSLT checks. 

The schema location specified in each of the sample files assumes that the root of the QIF schema directory structure is in the immediate parent directory of the sample file. So, if you wanted to validate these instance files against the schema, you should set up your directory structure to look something like this: 

```
C:/QIF/QIFApplications/
C:/QIF/QIFLibrary/
C:/QIF/MySampleFiles/<insert_sample_file_here>.qif
```

In the folder `SampleXSLTCheckInstanceFiles`, you will find sample files for running the XSLT checks.
